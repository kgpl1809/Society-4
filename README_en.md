## Features


### Chess but in our way...

We have been inspired by the modern society of our days to modify and change the pieces presented in chess.
However, we have made various modifications to the original game such as :
  - Society^4 is played with 4 players 
  - All pieces have abilities depending on their category, with the exception of the citizen
  - Pieces can morph to the next level in the hierarchy
  - The board is a chess-like board, but with half chess boards added on each side, which forms a cross
  
  
### Menu
  - Some secrets hidden all around the menu,  find them !

### Python and Pyxel

The pyxel module has been used to display all the pieces and icons. The code is divided in two sections, one being for all the calculations and the other for the graphical part corresponding to display and imagery. The use of dictionaries is omnipresent throughout the code to be able to assign parameters to each object. 
Pyxel being a module used throughout the year of NSI to train us to the night of the code.

### Display and Drawings on Pyxel

The sprites drawn on Pyxel were done by hand without any reference object or specific idea in mind. We had to imagine and draw from what we imagined when we were theorycrafting and brainstorming. The display of the abilities was quite long and tricky, as we wanted to give an animated effect for certain abilities. We had to draw the same image several times but change its appearance and display them repeatedly one after another to give an animated effect. The number of images and sprites drawn far exceeds what we originally thought, and took way longer to get it down to how we wanted it to in the end.

### Menu and Easter Egg

  - Interactive menu to allow the user to understand how the game works.
  - Easter Eggs can be accessed to play mini-games.
  - Catch a star that is wandering in one of the menus? Click on anything that moves? Lots of things to discover !


### Installation

As for the installation of the random module, you just have to replace in the above command : "pyxel" by "random".

### Usage
We have made the user interface quite simple to navigate in order to facilitate the accessibility of our game. So there are no additional commands to enter when the game is running. However, if it happens that our game stops working, please refresh the page you are on, or restart the code depending on how you launched the game.


# 1 - The Rules

Society^4 is a game similar to chess with 4 players but locally. Each player has 16 pieces including 8 Citizens, 2 Workers, 2 Soldiers, 2 Hackers, 1 Minister and 1 President. To win the game, you must be the only one to have your president alive, taking into consideration that a player can be eliminated if he doesn't play within the time limit of each turn. 



Players can choose the mode they want: easy mode - 1 min per turn; medium mode - 30 sec per turn; 
extreme mode - 9 sec per turn. 


Unlike traditional chess, all pieces have special abilities.



## How to play?

When you start the game, a menu will be displayed with several options: "Play" ("Jouer"), "Help" ("Aide"), "Credits" ("Credits") and the "Quit" ("Quitter") option to close the game. Play will send you to a screen allowing you to choose what time mode you want to play in then where each team/player can choose which ability they want to have on their minister.  To move pieces, simply hover your mouse on the piece you want to move then left click on said piece, some squares all around the board will change from white/black to a gray-ish color, that indicates which squares your piece can move to. And as for the abilites it works the same. Help, will give you a list of menus explaining each piece, ability and interaction.
 


Be careful... Using the ability of any piece consumes your turn.


## The pawn hierarchy

When a piece captures any minister, it evolves to the next level. You can see the order in which they evolve in the image below:

# 2 - The pieces


## Each piece is different 
  - The "Citizen" ("Citoyen") is the chess pawn which can move two squares in one direction at it's first move, then move one square for the rest of the game, can capture another pieces diagonally 


  - The "Worker" ("Ouvrier") is the chess knight who moves in an L-shape (two squares in one direction, then one square to the left or right) and can capture pieces in this way 


  - The "Soldier" ("Soldat") is the chess rook that moves horizontally and vertically only and can capture pieces in this way. When this piece is captured, it will leave a grave on this square, blocking the square and can be reanimated by one of the Ministers. Be careful, the grave can be eaten by a citizen who will then become a zombie.

  - The "Hacker" ("Pirate") is the chess bishop that moves diagonally only and can capture pieces in this way. When this piece is captured, it will leave a grave on that square, blocking the square, and can be reanimated by one of the Ministers. 


  - The "Minister" ("Ministre") is the chess queen who can move diagonally, horizontally and vertically and can capture pieces in this way, he also posesses different abilities which can be chosen at after selecting which time mode you want to play in


  - The "President" ("President") is the chess king who can move one square in any direction and can capture pieces in this way, when a team's king dies, every one of that team's pieces get wiped off the board




  - The tomb appears on the square when a Soldier or Hacker dies. This tomb blocks the square it is on indefinitely, however one of the 4 ministers that can be chosen at the beginning of the game can revive the piece lost in battle


### Abilities
  - The Citizen : has no abilities, transforms into a Worker after the capture of a Minister


  - The Worker : can block a square for 4 turns, transforms into a Soldier following the capture of a Minister (4 turns of cooldown, in a circle of radius of 2 squares)

  - The Soldier: can lay a mine nearby which lasts 9 turns, eliminates a piece that lands on it, turns into a Hacker after capturing a Minister (7 turns of cooldown, in a radius of 2 squares around him)


![image_soldat_capa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/131470894/234657525-1c7a633e-33f8-42eb-8111-054889eac218.png)


  - The Hacker : can move an allied piece within a radius of 2 squares around it, regardless of its category, in a predefined way, transforms into a Minister following the capture of a Minister (12 turns cooldown). It can also move citizens which can then capture other pieces. Be careful if the zombie kills a minister, the piece will be reanimated but will also receive its evolution.

  - The Minister : When a Minister is captured by another Minister, he improves the capacity of the latter (Lasts longer and less time to reload).
      - Minister 1 : set fire to a chosen square for 3 turns
