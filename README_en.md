## Features


### Chess but in our way...

We have been inspired by the modern society of our days to modify and change the pieces presented in chess.
However, we have made various modifications to the original game such as :
  - Society^4 is played with 4 players 
  - All pieces have abilities except the citizen, these abilities are different depending on the pieces
  - Pieces can morph to the next level in the hierarchy
  - The board is a chess-like board, but with half chess boards added on each side, which forms a kind of cross
  
  
### Menu
  - Some secrets hidden in the menu, you have to find them !

### Python and Pyxel

The pyxel module has been used to display all the pieces and icons. So the code is divided in two big parts, the part with all the calculations and the graphical part with all the display. The use of dictionaries is also omnipresent throughout the code to be able to assign parameters to each object. 
Pyxel being a module used during all the year of NSI to train us to the night of the code. So this project also allowed us to prepare for the Night of Code. 

### Display and Drawings on Pyxel

The sprites drawn on Pyxel were done by hand without any reference object or specific idea in mind. We had to imagine and draw a little from what we imagined when we thought about the parts we drew. The display of the abilities was quite long and difficult, as we wanted to give an animated effect for the abilities of each piece. We had to draw the same image several times but change its appearance and display them repeatedly one after another to give this animation effect. The number of images and sprites drawn far exceeds what was originally thought.

### Menu and Easter Egg

  - Interactive menu to allow the user to understand how the game works.
  - Easter Eggs can be accessed to play mini-games.
  - Catch a star that is wandering in one of the menus? Click on anything that moves? Lots of things to discover!
